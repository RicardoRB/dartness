## Description

Dartness is a framework for building efficient, scalable dart server-side applications. It provides an easy and quick
way to develop modern standalone server.

Under the hood, Dartness makes use of [shelf](https://github.com/dart-lang/shelf).

Inspired by [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) and [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
frameworks

## Getting started

You can run the example with the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
like this:

```
$ dart run bin/server.dart
Server listening on port 8080
```
